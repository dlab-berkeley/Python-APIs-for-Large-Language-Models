    "\n",
    "### Scenario 1: Thematic Identification\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Zero-Shot Prompt:** \"What is the theme of this story about a detective who solves a case using a seemingly insignificant detail?\"\n",
    "* **Likely Zero-Shot Response:** \"The theme of the story is attention to detail, as the detective's success hinges on a small, overlooked fact.\"\n",
    "This is a good response, but what if you wanted it to be just a single word? Let's use few-shot prompting to guide it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Few-Shot Prompt:**\n",
    "    * **Input 1:** \"A young woman moves to a new city and learns to navigate a demanding job and a new social circle.\"\n",
    "    * **Output 1:** \"Theme: Coming-of-age\"\n",
    "    * **Input 2:** \"Two rival knights must team up to defeat a dragon that is terrorizing their kingdoms.\"\n",
    "    * **Output 2:** \"Theme: Collaboration\"\n",
    "    * **Input 3:** \"A story about a detective who solves a case using a seemingly insignificant detail.\"\n",
    "* **Likely Few-Shot Response:** \"Theme: Attention to detail\"\n",
    "By giving just two examples, we've taught the model the exact output format we want: Theme: [single word].\n",

    "### Scenario 2: Simple Data Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you need to extract specific information, like names and dates?\n",

    "* **Likely Few-Shot Response:** \"Name: Jane Doe, Date: October 26, 2024\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario 3: Abstract Text Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Few-shot prompting can even be used for more abstract tasks, like determining a character's alignment based on their actions, a common task in fantasy or game-related analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Zero-Shot Prompt:** \"Is a character who regularly disobeys laws to help others and who values personal freedom over societal order good, evil, or neutral?\"\n",
    "* **Likely Zero-Shot Response:** \"A character who regularly disobeys laws to help others and values personal freedom over societal order could be considered a chaotic good character in many alignment systems.\"\n",
    "This is a good, detailed answer, but what if you want a simpler classification? We can provide examples of what \"lawful,\" \"chaotic,\" \"good,\" and \"evil\" mean in practice to guide the model's output.\n",
    "\n",

    "    * **Input 1:** \"A character who robs a corrupt merchant to give gold to the poor, believing personal conscience is more important than law.\"\n",
    "    * **Output 1:** \"Alignment: Chaotic Good\"\n",
    "    * **Input 2:** \"A character who follows every law and rule to the letter, even if it leads to a bad outcome.\"\n",

    "## Conclusion: What We've Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, you've moved from the conceptual understanding of LLM APIs to hands-on, programmatic control. You now have the foundational knowledge to build powerful, automated workflows with language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a quick summary of the key concepts you’ve mastered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **API Mechanics:** You understand that LLM APIs are **stateless**. To simulate memory and maintain context, you are **responsible for managing the message history** yourself by sending a full list of messages with each new request.\n",
    "2.  **The Power of Roles:** You know how to use the `system`, `user`, and `assistant` roles to give the model instructions, provide it with your prompts, and capture its responses. The `system` role is particularly powerful for setting high-level rules and persona.\n",
    "3.  **Zero-Shot vs. Few-Shot Prompting:** You've seen how **zero-shot** prompting is great for general tasks but can result in inconsistent output. In contrast, **few-shot** prompting is essential for guiding the model to produce a consistent, predictable format by providing it with a single example or a few examples.\n",
    "4.  **Structured Output:** You now have the ultimate tool for reliability: **structured output with Pydantic**. By defining a `BaseModel`, you can give the LLM a clear blueprint for its response, and the `.parse` method ensures the output is always a valid, usable Python object. This is the critical step for moving from simple chat to scalable data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific example we worked through of thematic coding of a narrative is just one use case. The most powerful concept you’ve learned today is the idea of using structured output to programmatically define how the LLM should respond. This is a foundational technique that you can apply across all social science workflows, whether you are doing **data extraction**, **summarization**, or **classification**. By providing the LLM with a schema, you gain precise control over its output, making it a reliable and powerful tool for your research."
