    "## This Workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of us have used tools like ChatGPT or Claude, but what you may not realize is that these interfaces are **not the language models themselves**. They’re polished applications built on top of large language models (LLMs), adding helpful features like memory, chat formatting, context injection, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we’ll peel back the layers and explore:\n",
    "- **How LLMs are hosted and accessed through APIs**\n",
    "- **How tools like ChatGPT are built around them**\n",
    "- **How LLM's can be useful in social science research**\n",
    "- **How you can interface directly with LLMs via API calls to power your social science research workflows**\n",
    "\n",
    "This shift from using LLMs in chat to using them as infrastructure unlocks powerful possibilities for research:\n",
    "- Extracting structured data from unstructured text  \n",
    "- Performing thematic coding across interview transcripts  \n",
    "- Generating summaries, classifications, and annotations at scale  \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you'll know how to go from “let me ask ChatGPT a question” to let me integrate LLMs into my own social science research workflow to classify data, extract insights, and analyze content at scale."

    "## LLMs as a Research Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we even get into the programmatic use of LLMs, let's break down a few of the methods and how they can be useful in your social science workflow. \n",
    "\n",
    "Across a wide variety of research workflows, LLMs can be used to: \n",
    "- **Analyze Qualitative Data**: Perform thematic coding, sentiment analysis, and information extraction from interview transcripts, field notes, and open-ended survey responses.\n",
    "    - *For example*: A social scientist could automatically identify recurring themes like \"systemic barriers\" or \"lack of institutional support\" across 50 interview transcripts, saving dozens of hours of manual review.\n",
    "- **Classify Content**: Categorize thousands of social media posts, news articles, or legal documents based on predefined criteria.\n",
    "    - *For example*: A political scientist could classify thousands of tweets about a new policy as \"in favor,\" \"against,\" or \"neutral,\" allowing for large-scale analysis of public opinion.\n",
    "- **Summarize and Synthesize**: Generate concise summaries of long texts, helping you quickly identify key arguments and recurring patterns across a large corpus.\n",
    "    - *For example*: A historian could feed a model hundreds of personal letters from a historical period and ask it to identify common sentiments or events, providing a high-level overview before a deeper dive.\n",
    "- **Create Structured Data with `StructuredOutput`**: Transform messy, unstructured text into clean, structured data (e.g., JSON) that is ready for quantitative analysis.\n",
    "    - *For example*: An urban planner could extract specific details like a building's address, construction date, and historical zoning designation from a collection of digitized city reports, building a database for further analysis. This workshop will focus on the last two points, showing you how to go from unstructured text to usable data at scale. The following scenario is just one example of how this can be applied."

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're a social science researcher helping compile a book like [When the City Stopped](https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501780387/when-the-city-stopped/), a project that gathered, sorted, and categorized stories from essential workers across New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic. You’ve sent out an open call and collected hundreds of open-ended stories from nurses, EMTs, grocery clerks, MTA workers, and others. These personal narratives capture moments of fear, resilience, trauma, grief, and hope. You want to analyze them systematically.\n",
    "\n",

    "![Manual Thematic Coding](../images/chatGPT_approach.png)\n",
    "At some point, you realize: \"What if I just paste this into ChatGPT and ask it to extract that structured information for me!\" \n",

    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",

    "  \"material_conditions\": [\"PPE shortage\"],\n",

    "  \"theme\": \"invisibility of labor\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But you still Have thousands of more more samples to get through. You still have to:\n",
    "- Manually copy and paste each sample into the UI\n",
    "- Copy and append the output to a document or spreadsheet\n",
    "- Hope ChatGPT stays consistent\n",
    "- And most importantly, repeat this process thousands of times\n",
    "\n",
    "Seems like something that would be made easy if you could just programmatically call ChatGPT or whichever the model is that it utilizes behind the scenes.\n",

    "![Manual Thematic Coding](../images/llm_automated.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of working through a web interface, what if you could:\n",
    "- Programmatically send each sample to the model  \n",
    "- Receive structured, reliable JSON responses  \n",
    "- Save everything automatically into a CSV or database  \n",
    "- Scale up from 10 samples to 10,000\n",

    "At its core, a Large Language Model is just a giant neural network:  a trained set of weights and biases. When you ask it something you’re running what’s called a **forward pass or inference**. You pass in some input text, and the model predicts the next most likely word (again and again, until it's done). Theoretically, if you had a computer powerful enough you could run this set of weights and biases locally on your computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, in practice the SoTa (state of the art models) tend to be much, much larger than what you can fit on your computer. When you use ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini, you’re not actually running the model on your laptop. Behind the scenes, you're sending a request to a Large Language Model (LLM) hosted on a powerful server that is capable of running these giant models. They can require hundreds of gigabytes of memory and need specialized hardware like GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hosted LLMs and API Servers\n",
    "Because running an LLM requires this massive amount of compute resources, companies host them on the cloud and provide access through something called an API Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "An API (Application Programming Interface) server gives your application a way to:\n",
    "- Send text to the model (request),\n",
    "- Run an inference (get predictions) remotely,\n",
    "- And receive the result back (response)\n",
    "\n",
    "So when you interact with ChatGPT, what’s really happening under the hood is something like this:\n",
    "ChatGPT UI  →  API Call  →  Hosted LLM  →  Output  →  ChatGPT UI\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern became the foundation for how LLMs are accessed at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Competing Standards for LLM APIs\n",
    "As more models were released, different organizations built their own API “specifications” for hosting LLMs. A few major ones emerged:\n",
    "\n",
    "- OpenAI API Spec – The most widely adopted standard, designed by OpenAI\n",
    "- Hugging Face TGI (Text Generation Inference) – Hugging Face’s approach to model serving\n",

    "- What endpoints (like /generate or /chat) should exist\n",

    "Similar to how phones began to converge on a single charging standard (like USB-C), the AI developer ecosystem has increasingly converged on OpenAI’s API format as a common interface for LLMs. Today, even third-party models like Mistral, Meta’s LLaMA, and others are often hosted behind APIs that support OpenAI-style endpoints, such as:\n",

    "\n",
    "OpenRouter is a unified API gateway for Large Language Models. It allows you to send a prompt to many different models (like GPT-4, Claude, Mistral, and others) using a single, consistent interface. Though OpenRouter doesn't host the LLM servers themselves, they allow you to interact with LLM hosts through one unified API. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to providing one unified experience, we are using OpenRouter since it doesn't require a credit card to interact with the free tier of models (though you are limited to 50 calls per day).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Set Up\n",
    "\n",
    "To use OpenRouter, you’ll need to:\n",
    "1. Create a free account at [https://openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)\n",
    "2. Click on your profile (top right) and generate an API key\n",
    "    - Settings -> API Keys -> Create API Key\n",
    "4. ⚠️ **Warning:** Save this API Key Somewhere Safe\n",
    "    -  It is generally best practice to save this key somewhere secure like an environment variable or in a secure file on your system.<br>\n",
    "    - This is a very sensitive key which allows you to interface directly with the API's. Do not share it with anyone or upload it to any public accounts like Github.\n",
    "    - You will only be able to view this key once, before you can't see it again. If you lose it, you will have to create a new one."
