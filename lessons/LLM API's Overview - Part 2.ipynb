This approach is invaluable for getting consistent, structured output from the model.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Scenario 1: Thematic Identification\n",

    "Imagine you want to identify the main theme of a short story. A simple instruction (zero-shot) might not give you the format you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Zero-Shot Prompt:** \"What is the theme of this story about a detective who solves a case using a seemingly insignificant detail?\"\n",
    "* **Likely Zero-Shot Response:** \"The theme of the story is attention to detail, as the detective's success hinges on a small, overlooked fact.\"\n",
    "This is a good response, but what if you wanted it to be just a single word? Let's use few-shot prompting to guide it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Few-Shot Prompt:**\n",
    "    * **Input 1:** \"A young woman moves to a new city and learns to navigate a demanding job and a new social circle.\"\n",
    "    * **Output 1:** \"Theme: Coming-of-age\"\n",
    "    * **Input 2:** \"Two rival knights must team up to defeat a dragon that is terrorizing their kingdoms.\"\n",
    "    * **Output 2:** \"Theme: Collaboration\"\n",
    "    * **Input 3:** \"A story about a detective who solves a case using a seemingly insignificant detail.\"\n",
    "* **Likely Few-Shot Response:** \"Theme: Attention to detail\"\n",
    "By giving just two examples, we've taught the model the exact output format we want: Theme: [single word].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario 2: Simple Data Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you need to extract specific information, like names and dates?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Zero-Shot Prompt:** \"Find the person's name and birthday in this sentence: 'The grand opening, attended by CEO Jane Doe, was held on October 26, 2024, to celebrate her 45th birthday.'\"\n",
    "* **Likely Zero-Shot Response:** \"The person's name is Jane Doe and her 45th birthday is on October 26, 2024.\"\n",
    "Again, the response is correct, but not in a format you can easily use in a spreadsheet or database. Now let's try a few-shot prompt to get a clean, structured list.\n",

    "    * **Input 1:** \"The presentation was given by Dr. Alan Turing on June 23, 1912.\"\n",
    "    * **Output 1:** \"Name: Alan Turing, Date: June 23, 1912\"\n",
    "    * **Input 2:** \"Marie Curie's discovery on November 7, 1867, changed the world.\"\n",
    "    * **Output 2:** \"Name: Marie Curie, Date: November 7, 1867\"\n",
    "    * **Input 3:** \"The grand opening, attended by CEO Jane Doe, was held on October 26, 2024, to celebrate her 45th birthday.\"\n",
    "* **Likely Few-Shot Response:** \"Name: Jane Doe, Date: October 26, 2024\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario 3: Abstract Text Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Few-shot prompting can even be used for more abstract tasks, like determining a character's alignment based on their actions, a common task in fantasy or game-related analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Zero-Shot Prompt:** \"Is a character who regularly disobeys laws to help others and who values personal freedom over societal order good, evil, or neutral?\"\n",
    "* **Likely Zero-Shot Response:** \"A character who regularly disobeys laws to help others and values personal freedom over societal order could be considered a chaotic good character in many alignment systems.\"\n",
    "This is a good, detailed answer, but what if you want a simpler classification? We can provide examples of what \"lawful,\" \"chaotic,\" \"good,\" and \"evil\" mean in practice to guide the model's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Few-Shot Prompt:**\n",
    "    * **Input 1:** \"A character who robs a corrupt merchant to give gold to the poor, believing personal conscience is more important than law.\"\n",
    "    * **Output 1:** \"Alignment: Chaotic Good\"\n",
    "    * **Input 2:** \"A character who follows every law and rule to the letter, even if it leads to a bad outcome.\"\n",
    "    * **Output 2:** \"Alignment: Lawful Neutral\"\n",
    "    * **Input 3:** \"A character who regularly disobeys laws to help others and who values personal freedom over societal order.\"\n",
    "* **Likely Few-Shot Response:** \"Alignment: Chaotic Good\"\n",
    "As you can see, the model learns the exact structure from the examples and applies it to the new input, making the output predictable and machine-readable. This simple technique is the foundation for getting the clean JSON responses we need for our research workflow."
