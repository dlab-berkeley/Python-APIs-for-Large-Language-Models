    "* **Likely Zero-Shot Response:** \"The theme of the story is attention to detail, as the detective's success hinges on a small, overlooked fact.\"\n",
    "This is a good response, but what if you wanted it to be just a single word? Let's use few-shot prompting to guide it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Few-Shot Prompt:**\n",
    "    * **Input 1:** \"A young woman moves to a new city and learns to navigate a demanding job and a new social circle.\"\n",
    "    * **Output 1:** \"Theme: Coming-of-age\"\n",
    "    * **Input 2:** \"Two rival knights must team up to defeat a dragon that is terrorizing their kingdoms.\"\n",
    "    * **Output 2:** \"Theme: Collaboration\"\n",

    "### Scenario 2: Simple Data Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you need to extract specific information, like names and dates?\n",

    "\n",
