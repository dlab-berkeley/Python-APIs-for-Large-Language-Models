      "The story you've shared is a poignant reflection on the role of front-line workers during a crisis, likely referencing the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar societal challenge. Here are the key themes extracted from the passage:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Essential Labor and Survival**: The narrative highlights the critical role of front-line workers (grocery workers, transit workers, first responders) in ensuring the literal survival of the city during a crisis. It shifts the focus from mere \"getting through\" a hardship to emphasizing their role in sustaining life and basic societal functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Underappreciation and Misperception**: The statement challenges a common perceptionâ€”that these workers merely \"helped the city get through it\"â€”by asserting a deeper truth: their labor was foundational to survival. This suggests a frustration with how their contributions might be minimized or oversimplified by society.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Sacrifice and Resilience**: The tone implies that front-line workers bore a disproportionate burden, enduring risks (e.g., health hazards, long hours) to keep others safe and the city functioning. Their actions are framed as an act of collective resilience.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Intersection of Visibility and Value**: Grocery and transit workers, often undervalued in pre-crisis times, are elevated to the same level as first responders, underscoring how crises reveal the true indispensability of certain roles.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Collective Dependence on Marginalized Labor**: The story subtly critiques societal structures that rely on often underpaid or overlooked workers in times of need, questioning whether this dependence is met with fair recognition or systemic change.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Semantic Resistance**: The shift from \"get through\" to \"survive\" is a deliberate linguistic choice, reclaiming the narrative to reflect the gravity of the workers' contributions. It challenges listeners to reframe their understanding of crisis and labor.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Nuanced Takeaway**: The story is both a tribute to front-line workers and a critique of how society acknowledges (or fails to acknowledge) their existential role. It calls for a deeper recognition of labor that is deemed \"essential\" only in hindsight.\n"

    "### Scenario 1: Thematic Identification\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Zero-Shot Prompt:** \"What is the theme of this story about a detective who solves a case using a seemingly insignificant detail?\"\n",
    "* **Likely Zero-Shot Response:** \"The theme of the story is attention to detail, as the detective's success hinges on a small, overlooked fact.\"\n",
    "This is a good response, but what if you wanted it to be just a single word? Let's use few-shot prompting to guide it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Few-Shot Prompt:**\n",
    "    * **Input 1:** \"A young woman moves to a new city and learns to navigate a demanding job and a new social circle.\"\n",
    "    * **Output 1:** \"Theme: Coming-of-age\"\n",
    "    * **Input 2:** \"Two rival knights must team up to defeat a dragon that is terrorizing their kingdoms.\"\n",
    "    * **Output 2:** \"Theme: Collaboration\"\n",
    "    * **Input 3:** \"A story about a detective who solves a case using a seemingly insignificant detail.\"\n",
    "* **Likely Few-Shot Response:** \"Theme: Attention to detail\"\n",
    "By giving just two examples, we've taught the model the exact output format we want: Theme: [single word].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario 2: Simple Data Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you need to extract specific information, like names and dates?\n",

    "* **Likely Few-Shot Response:** \"Name: Jane Doe, Date: October 26, 2024\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario 3: Abstract Text Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Few-shot prompting can even be used for more abstract tasks, like determining a character's alignment based on their actions, a common task in fantasy or game-related analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Zero-Shot Prompt:** \"Is a character who regularly disobeys laws to help others and who values personal freedom over societal order good, evil, or neutral?\"\n",
    "* **Likely Zero-Shot Response:** \"A character who regularly disobeys laws to help others and values personal freedom over societal order could be considered a chaotic good character in many alignment systems.\"\n",
    "This is a good, detailed answer, but what if you want a simpler classification? We can provide examples of what \"lawful,\" \"chaotic,\" \"good,\" and \"evil\" mean in practice to guide the model's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Few-Shot Prompt:**\n",
    "    * **Input 1:** \"A character who robs a corrupt merchant to give gold to the poor, believing personal conscience is more important than law.\"\n",
    "    * **Output 1:** \"Alignment: Chaotic Good\"\n",
    "    * **Input 2:** \"A character who follows every law and rule to the letter, even if it leads to a bad outcome.\"\n",
    "    * **Output 2:** \"Alignment: Lawful Neutral\"\n",
    "    * **Input 3:** \"A character who regularly disobeys laws to help others and who values personal freedom over societal order.\"\n",

    "## Conclusion: What We've Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, you've moved from the conceptual understanding of LLM APIs to hands-on, programmatic control. You now have the foundational knowledge to build powerful, automated workflows with language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s a quick summary of the key concepts youâ€™ve mastered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **API Mechanics:** You understand that LLM APIs are **stateless**. To simulate memory and maintain context, you are **responsible for managing the message history** yourself by sending a full list of messages with each new request.\n",
    "2.  **The Power of Roles:** You know how to use the `system`, `user`, and `assistant` roles to give the model instructions, provide it with your prompts, and capture its responses. The `system` role is particularly powerful for setting high-level rules and persona.\n",
    "3.  **Zero-Shot vs. Few-Shot Prompting:** You've seen how **zero-shot** prompting is great for general tasks but can result in inconsistent output. In contrast, **few-shot** prompting is essential for guiding the model to produce a consistent, predictable format by providing it with a single example or a few examples.\n",
    "4.  **Structured Output:** You now have the ultimate tool for reliability: **structured output with Pydantic**. By defining a `BaseModel`, you can give the LLM a clear blueprint for its response, and the `.parse` method ensures the output is always a valid, usable Python object. This is the critical step for moving from simple chat to scalable data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific example we worked through of thematic coding of a narrative is just one use case. The most powerful concept youâ€™ve learned today is the idea of using structured output to programmatically define how the LLM should respond. This is a foundational technique that you can apply across all social science workflows, whether you are doing **data extraction**, **summarization**, or **classification**. By providing the LLM with a schema, you gain precise control over its output, making it a reliable and powerful tool for your research."
